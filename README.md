# Arma 3 Installation Script for Linux hosted dedicated servers

This software was developed with the purpose of making the install and basic configuring of an Arma 3(with or without mods) a little bit more intuitive.

The step by step i followed was in this three part tutorial:

**1. [Part 1: Getting Started ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq-s9xXTEMs&t=2s)**

**2. [Part 2: Server configuration ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZq_uFi7o3s)**

**3. [Part 3: Steam workshop mods ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA89e6VJ63M)**


**I'm, in no way, associated with the author of this video**, it just helped me a lot when i was hours into trying to configure the server with no success.

# Install and use

You just need to download the shellscript and run it as root(sus i know)

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deathToAI/Arma3_Barebones_DedicatedServer/refs/heads/main/Arma3_Barebones_DedicatedServer.sh` 

It will present you with options (see placeholder image below), and you can select one.

# Improvements

The entire code is free to use and modify as you see fit.

**I’m not a professional programmer**, I just like tech stuff and gaming, so if you see a way to improve it, make a pull request, and I’ll be happy to be in touch and consider changes.

>Simple does it.
